        "### Observation\n",
        "Despite training logs showing a 100% success rate for the DQN agent by episode 250 (and maintaining it afterwards), running the `demo` command with models like `dqn_checkpoint_ep2000.pth`, `dqn_checkpoint_ep3000.pth`, `dqn_checkpoint_ep5000.pth`, and `dqn_final.pth` consistently results in a 0% success rate. This indicates a significant discrepancy between the agent's performance during training and its behavior in the demo environment.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Potential Causes\n",
        "Possible reasons for this discrepancy include:\n",
        "*   **Incorrect Model Loading**: The model might not be loaded correctly in the demo script, leading to random or untrained behavior.\n",
        "*   **Environment Mismatch**: Differences in how the maze environment is initialized or reset between training and demo modes.\n",
        "*   **Agent Logic Discrepancy**: The agent's decision-making logic in demo mode might differ from its training logic.\n",
        "*   **Input/Output Mismatch**: The input state to the neural network or the interpretation of its output might be different in the demo.\n",

        "3.  **Inspect `src/dqn_network.py`**: Verify the neural network architecture definition.\n",
        "4.  **Inspect `src/dqn_agent.py`**: Check the agent's action selection mechanism (`select_action` method) during evaluation.\n",
        "5.  **Inspect `src/maze_environment.py`**: Look for any differences in maze generation or reward structure that might affect the demo versus training."

        "### Analysis of `demo.py` for the `demo_agent` function\n",
        "\n",
        "Upon reviewing `demo.py`, the `demo_agent` function performs the following key actions:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Model Loading**: It attempts to load the model from `model_path` using `agent.load(model_path)`. There's an `os.path.exists` check, but no explicit verification that the *loaded* model is functional or matches the expected architecture. The `try-except` block catches generic exceptions during loading.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Environment Initialization**: A `MazeEnvironment` is initialized with `maze_size` and `render_size`. This seems consistent with training parameters.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **Agent Initialization**: A `DQNAgent` is initialized. Crucially, `epsilon_start=0.0` and `epsilon_end=0.0` are set, meaning **no exploration** occurs during the demo. This is expected for a trained agent. `use_dueling=True` is also set, which should match the training if dueling DQN was used.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  **Action Selection**: The agent's action is selected using `action = agent.select_action(state, training=False)`. The `training=False` argument implies that the agent should use its learned policy without exploration (due to epsilon being 0.0).\n",
        "\n",
        "5.  **Episode Timeout**: There's a timeout condition: `if steps > maze_size * maze_size * 2:`. If the agent doesn't reach the goal within this many steps, the episode is considered a failure.\n",
        "\n",
        "6.  **Success Check**: `success = env._is_goal_reached()` is used to determine if the goal was reached.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Potential Issues Identified in `demo.py`:**\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Missing `render_size` match with training**: The comment `# Size of rendered images - must match training (default: 84)` under `main.py` suggests that `render_size` is crucial. While both `main.py`'s `train` and `demo` commands default `render_size` to 84, it's vital to ensure that the *actual* `render_size` used during training (when the model was saved) matches the `render_size` used during the demo. If the agent was trained on a different `render_size` than what's being used in the demo (default 84), the input state to the DQN might be inconsistent, leading to poor performance.\n",
        "*   **`DQNAgent` Initialization Parameters**: The `DQNAgent` in demo mode is initialized with `input_shape=(render_size, render_size, 3)`. It's critical that this `input_shape` matches the `input_shape` the agent was trained on. If `render_size` was different during training, the network architecture might implicitly be different or the input data misinterpreted.\n",
        "*   **`use_dueling` Parameter**: `use_dueling=True` is explicitly set in `DQNAgent` initialization. It's important to verify if the model was indeed trained with dueling DQN.

        "    *   `epsilon_start`, `epsilon_end`, `epsilon_decay`: These parameters control the epsilon-greedy exploration strategy during training. For demo mode (`training=False`), `epsilon` is effectively ignored by the `select_action` method.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **`select_action` method:**\n",
        "    *   When `training=True`, it uses an epsilon-greedy approach, picking a random action with probability `self.epsilon` or a greedy action from the `policy_net`.\n",
        "    *   When `training=False` (as in the demo), it always performs a greedy action selection: it calls `self._preprocess_state(state)`, passes the resulting tensor to `self.policy_net`, and returns the `argmax().item()` of the `q_values` without any exploration.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **`_preprocess_state` method:**\n",
        "    *   This method is responsible for converting the incoming `numpy.ndarray` state from `(H, W, C)` format to `(C, H, W)` format, converting it to a PyTorch `FloatTensor`, and adding a batch dimension (`.unsqueeze(0)`).\n",
        "\n",
        "**Potential Issues Identified from `src/dqn_agent.py`:**\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **`input_shape` Consistency**: The `DQNAgent` expects the input state in `(H, W, C)` format, which is then internally converted to `(C, H, W)`. It's crucial that the `render_size` (which contributes to H and W) passed to `DQNAgent` during its initialization in `demo.py` matches the `render_size` used during training. If the rendered image size from `MazeEnvironment` (which is passed as `input_shape` to `DQNAgent`) doesn't match the size the `DQNNetwork` was originally trained with, the loaded model will receive malformed input, leading to incorrect predictions.\n",
        "*   **`use_dueling` Consistency**: The `use_dueling` parameter is critical. If a model trained with a `DQNNetwork` (i.e., `use_dueling=False`) is loaded into an agent initialized with `use_dueling=True` (and thus expecting a `DuelingDQNNetwork`), or vice-versa, the network architectures won't match, causing errors during model loading or incorrect behavior if loading succeeds but the architectures are incompatible.\n",
        "    *   From `demo.py`, we see `use_dueling=True` is hardcoded for `DQNAgent` initialization in demo mode. This means that *all* models loaded for demo *must* have been trained using `use_dueling=True`.\n",
        "\n",
        "To confirm these potential issues, the next logical steps are:\n",
        "1.  Examine `src/dqn_network.py` to understand the architectures of `DQNNetwork` and `DuelingDQNNetwork`.\n",
        "2.  Examine `src/train.py` to see how the `DQNAgent` is initialized during training, specifically the `render_size` and `use_dueling` parameters, and how models are saved. This is critical for determining if the demo's agent initialization matches the training conditions of the saved models."

        "\n",
        "Upon reviewing `src/dqn_network.py`, both `DQNNetwork` and `DuelingDQNNetwork` are defined. They share a similar convolutional base but differ in their final layers:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **`DQNNetwork` (Standard DQN):**\n",
        "    *   **Input Shape**: Expects `input_shape` as `(channels, height, width)`. This is consistent with the conversion performed in `DQNAgent._preprocess_state`.\n",
        "    *   **Architecture**: Consists of three convolutional layers followed by two fully connected layers.\n",
        "        *   `conv1`: `input_shape[0]` channels -> 32 channels, kernel 8, stride 4\n",
        "        *   `conv2`: 32 channels -> 64 channels, kernel 4, stride 2\n",
        "        *   `conv3`: 64 channels -> 64 channels, kernel 3, stride 1\n",
        "        *   A `_get_conv_output_size` method dynamically calculates the flattened feature size after convolutions.\n",
        "        *   `fc1`: `feature_size` -> 512\n",
        "        *   `fc2`: 512 -> `num_actions` (outputs Q-values directly)\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **`DuelingDQNNetwork` (Dueling DQN):**\n",
        "    *   **Input Shape**: Also expects `input_shape` as `(channels, height, width)`, matching `DQNNetwork` and `DQNAgent`'s preprocessing.\n",
        "    *   **Architecture**: Shares the same three convolutional layers as `DQNNetwork`.\n",
        "    *   **Dueling Head**: After the shared convolutional features are flattened (`feature_size`):\n",
        "        *   **Value Stream**: Two fully connected layers (`value_fc1`, `value_fc2`) output a single scalar value representing the state-value function `V(s)`.\n",
        "        *   **Advantage Stream**: Two fully connected layers (`advantage_fc1`, `advantage_fc2`) output `num_actions` values representing the advantage function `A(s,a)`.\n",
        "        *   **Combination**: The Q-values are then calculated as `Q(s,a) = V(s) + (A(s,a) - mean(A(s,a)))`.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key Observations and Implications for Demo Discrepancy:**\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **`input_shape` Sensitivity**: Both networks are explicitly initialized with `input_shape`. If the `render_size` used during demo agent initialization (which forms `input_shape`) does not exactly match the `render_size` that the loaded model was trained with, the network architecture's convolutional layers' input dimensions will be mismatched. This would likely cause errors during `agent.load()` if the `input_shape` in the saved model's state_dict contains shape information, or runtime errors during forward pass if it doesn't.\n",
        "*   **`use_dueling` Parameter**: As noted in the `dqn_agent.py` analysis, `demo.py` hardcodes `use_dueling=True` when initializing the `DQNAgent`. This means the `demo_agent` expects to load a model that was trained with `DuelingDQNNetwork`. If a model trained with `DQNNetwork` (standard DQN) is loaded, it will result in a mismatch of network architectures, which can lead to loading errors or incorrect behavior if loaded successfully but with incompatible layers.\n",
        "\n",
        "To continue diagnosing the 0% success rate, the next critical step is to look at `src/train.py` to see exactly how models are trained and saved, particularly the `render_size` and `use_dueling` parameters used during training."

        "\n",
        "Upon reviewing `src/train.py`, here's what was found regarding agent initialization and model saving during training:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **`Trainer.__init__` method:**\n",
        "    *   `render_size`: The `Trainer` class takes `render_size` as an argument (defaulting to `84`). This `render_size` is then used to initialize the `MazeEnvironment` and to construct the `input_shape` for the `DQNAgent`:\n",
        "        ```python\n",
        "        self.env = MazeEnvironment(maze_size=maze_size, render_size=render_size)\n",
        "        input_shape = (render_size, render_size, 3)\n",
        "        self.agent = DQNAgent(\n",
        "            input_shape=input_shape,\n",
        "            # ... other parameters ...\n",
        "            use_dueling=True # <-- Crucial observation\n",
        "        )\n",
        "        ```\n",
        "    *   `use_dueling`: The `DQNAgent` is explicitly initialized with `use_dueling=True` during training.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **`train` method:**\n",
        "    *   `save_freq`: Models are saved at a frequency defined by `self.save_freq` (defaulting to `100`). The filename format is `dqn_checkpoint_ep{episode + 1}.pth`.\n",
        "    *   Final Model: A `dqn_final.pth` model is saved at the very end of training.\n",
        "    *   Early Stopping: If early stopping is triggered, a model named `dqn_early_stopped_ep{episode + 1}.pth` is saved.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key Findings and Resolution for Demo Discrepancy:**\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **`render_size` Consistency**: The `Trainer` initializes the `DQNAgent` with an `input_shape` derived directly from `render_size`. Since the default `render_size` in `train.py` is `84`, and the `demo.py` also defaults to `render_size=84`, there is **no mismatch in `render_size`** when using default parameters.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **`use_dueling` Consistency**: The `DQNAgent` in `train.py` is explicitly configured to use `use_dueling=True`. This perfectly matches the hardcoded `use_dueling=True` setting in `demo.py`. Therefore, there is **no mismatch in the Dueling DQN architecture** between training and demo.\n",
        "\n",
        "**New Hypothesis for 0% Success Rate in Demo:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Given that `render_size` and `use_dueling` parameters are consistent between training and demo, the persistent 0% success rate during demo suggests a deeper issue. The most likely cause is that the maze environment used for the demo is *different* from the maze environment on which the agent was trained. While the `maze-size` argument (defaulting to `8` in our training run) is consistent, the *actual maze layout* is randomly generated each time `MazeEnvironment` is instantiated. If the demo is consistently generating mazes that the trained agent has not learned to solve (e.g., highly complex or pathologically difficult for a general policy), or if there's a subtle difference in maze generation between training and demo, this could explain the failure.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Next Steps:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Examine `src/maze_environment.py`**: Specifically, look for any differences in maze generation, initialization, or state representation that could lead to inconsistencies between training and demo runs, even with the same `maze_size` parameter.\n",
        "2.  **Verify Maze Generation Seed**: Check if the maze generation is seeded during training or demo. If not, the agent might be tested on completely unseen maze layouts. If it is, ensure the same seed is used for comparison."

        "### Analysis of `src/maze_environment.py`\n",
        "\n",
        "Upon reviewing `src/maze_environment.py`, the following key aspects regarding maze generation and environment mechanics were found:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Maze Generation (`_generate_maze` method):**\n",
        "    *   The `_generate_maze` method uses a recursive backtracking algorithm.\n",
        "    *   Crucially, within this method, `np.random.shuffle(directions)` is called. This means that the order in which the algorithm carves paths is *randomized* for each new maze generated.\n",
        "    *   **There is no random seed set** for `numpy` at the beginning of the `MazeEnvironment` class or the `_generate_maze` function. This implies that every time a `MazeEnvironment` object is instantiated, a completely *new, random maze layout* is created.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Start and Goal Positions (`_find_start_position`, `_find_goal_position` methods):**\n",
        "    *   These methods search for the first available path cell from the top-left and bottom-right corners, respectively. While deterministic given a maze, they effectively depend on the random maze generation.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **State Representation (`_get_observation` method):**\n",
        "    *   The observation is an RGB image of the maze with the agent and goal positions. The `render_size` parameter (default 400 for environment, 84 for DQN input) determines the visual resolution, which we've confirmed is consistent between training and demo configurations by default.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  **Reward Structure (`_calculate_reward` method):**\n",
        "    *   The reward system provides +100 for reaching the goal, -0.1 per step, and an additional small penalty based on distance to the goal.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Conclusion and Root Cause Identification:**\n",
        "\n",
        "**The root cause of the 0% success rate in the demo is the unseeded random maze generation.**\n",
        "\n",
        "During training, the agent is exposed to a sequence of randomly generated mazes. When the training log shows a 100% success rate, it means the agent learned to solve *the specific random mazes it encountered during training*. However, because the `MazeEnvironment` does not use a fixed random seed, each time the `demo.py` script (or `train.py`) initializes a new `MazeEnvironment` object, it creates an entirely new maze that the agent has *never seen before*.\n",
        "\n",
        "The agent, even a well-trained one, has not developed a generalized policy to solve *any* 8x8 maze; rather, it has learned to solve the *training distribution* of 8x8 mazes. When faced with completely new, unseen mazes in the demo, it fails because it hasn't learned to generalize to all possible maze configurations.\n",
        "\n",
        "**To resolve this, the randomness in maze generation needs to be controlled.** This can be done by seeding the random number generator (`np.random.seed()`) before creating the `MazeEnvironment` instances for both training and demo, or by saving and loading the specific maze layout itself.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Next Steps:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Modify `src/maze_environment.py` to accept and use a random seed** for maze generation, or directly use `np.random.seed()` in `main.py` and `demo.py` before instantiating the environment to ensure reproducible maze layouts for testing. Alternatively, save the maze layout (or the seed used to generate it) during training and load it during demo."

This will involve updating the `__init__` method and using `np.random.seed()`.\n",
